Const variables in JavaScript have a behavior that I would not expect. Coming from a .NET/C# background const, behaves quite a bit differently than what I was used to.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Looking at the developer documentation for JavaScript, the declaration of a **const **"creates a constant whose scope can be either global or local to the block in which it is declared" ([docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const#:~:text=The%20const%20declaration%20creates%20a,variable%20identifier%20cannot%20be%20reassigned.&text=A%20constant%20cannot%20share%20its,variable%20in%20the%20same%20scope.)). That sounds all normal; well because it is so far.

As we read further, we get to this line: "The **`const` declaration** creates a read-only reference to a value. It does **not** mean the value it holds is **immutable**—just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned." The VERY important piece here is that the **VALUE IS NOT IMMUTABLE**.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Immutable? What the heck does immutable mean? Well, if an object is immutable, for that instance the properties cannot be changed. But since **const **objects are NOT immutable; it means that a **const **object can have its \_properties \_changed within it.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

That's just how it is and we have to work with it but if you come from the C# world and you think of a **const **never changing, be prepared for a **const **to be non-immutable in JavaScript.

#### Valid Example

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Looking at a code example, this is a **valid **usage of const where we change the non-immutable value of an underlying property.

#### Invalid Example

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Now, it wouldn't be called **const **if everything was not constant about our objects. In the docs, we see that "the variable identifier cannot be reassigned". What this means is that we cannot \_completely \_reassign our **const **reference.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The following code is an example of what we **CANNOT **do with a **const**:

**const **in JavaScript made me uneasy at first. The ability to change properties within a **const **was a new concept to me. However, I took the time to learn about it and understand it. I hope that after this **const** is a little less scary for you as well.
