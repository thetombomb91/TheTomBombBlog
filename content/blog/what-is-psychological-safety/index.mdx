As I go to more conferences and attend more talks, I hear the term psychological safety. It is something that teams strive for. It creates more productive teams. It creates high performing teams. I do not want to get into the benefits and ways to achieve psychological safety here in this post but I want to define for myself what psychological safety is.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

The current Wikipedia definition is, Psychological safety is a shared belief that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

I want to emphasize the **interpersonal** aspect and **shared belief** as these are the most important aspects to me. At its most basic, team members must be able to be themselves and feel compelled to share their ideas and perspective. And to go with that **everyone** on the team must feel this way.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Be it about work-related matters or even personal matters. To be safe the whole team must be comfortable talking.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Let's explain the ability to talk a little more. A team is not safe if the words of one member outweigh the words of another simply because of seniority, experience, etc. Everyone should be comfortable to share their opinions. Everyone on the team must feel psychological safety for a team to actually be considered safe. Even if just one member of the team is on the outside keeping thoughts or ideas to themselves this is not safe. It needs to be the entire team.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Should feel no possibility of humiliation, retaliation, or ill thoughts when sharing ideas. Should always know that members have the best intentions in mind.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Give example that could be construed as attack but is not because of safe environment.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In conclusion what this all sums up to is that everyone on the team must be at a level of comfort where they can be themselves and express all the ideas they have. Now I have given no insights into how psychological safety is achieved. I plan on starting a series of posts on how it can be achieved and how I have felt safer on my own teams.
