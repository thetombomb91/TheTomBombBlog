<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Structural Directives in Angular modify what is displayed in a view. They live directly in the HTML. They modify our HTML by adding, removing, or manipulating elements.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Why are they called structural directives? It is because they modify the structure of the Document Object Model (DOM).

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Structural directives are easy to spot. They will begin with an asterisk (\*). And the two most common structural directives are **[\*ngIf](https://angular.io/api/common/NgIf)** and **[\*ngFor](https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#ngFor)**.

Above is how we use a **\*ngIf**. The if statement will evaluate on _TheTomBomb_ and only if that is true will it include "Thomas is the best" into our DOM and viewable to the user.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

If _TheTomBomb_ evaluates to false "Thomas is the best" will not display. And not only that, but it will also not be present in the DOM.

The above **\*ngFor** will print out a list of website url's. The _websites_ variable is a list of websites and we will loop of that and generate a new _&lt;li>_ for each one in our collection. So a new _&lt;li>_ element will be created in the DOM for each item in _websites_.

Structural directives are popular and give us added capabilities inside of our HTML. \*ngIf is perfect for showing and hiding data. \*ngFor is great when we need to generate repeated HTML.
