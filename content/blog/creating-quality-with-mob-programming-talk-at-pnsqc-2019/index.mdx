A few months back I was accepted to give a technical presentation at [PNSQC 2019](https://www.pnsqc.org/2019-conference/) (Pacific Northwest Software Quality Conference) titled Creating Quality with Mob Programming.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

My final draft of the technical write up has been turned in and will be published in the 2019 proceedings. The paper and findings will be shared at my presentation. I am excited and nervous about the presentation as it will be my first ever talk at a conference. I am definitely more excited than nervous though!
