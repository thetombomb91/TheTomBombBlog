Today I ran into a new problem in my Angular application. My Jasmine unit tests were running FOREVER. Every time the tests finished they just kept running again and again. I reached 1505 out of 490 unit tests run. I was very confused! location.reload was the problem!

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After finding the exact tests that were the culprit. (Thank you small commits!) It was narrowed down to a **location.reload()** call in my production Angular component code that was causing the issue.

So let's jump into how to handle a location.reload() in our production code from our tests. _Note: I did not want/need to test my location.reload(), I just wanted to get past it, essentially ignore it._

#### Step One

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

First off, we need to** move our location.reload() call, from our production code, into its own function**. We do this because it makes it MUCH easier for us to stub out a component level function in our test. So here we made a simple reloadPage function.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:embed {"url":"https://gist.github.com/thetombomb91/2335b26d6ae2d30ced914d85d138a227","type":"rich","providerNameSlug":"embed-handler","className":""} -->

https://gist.github.com/thetombomb91/2335b26d6ae2d30ced914d85d138a227

The reloadPage function in our production code simply calling location.reload()

<!-- /wp:embed -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->

#### **Step Two**

<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Next up, we go to our tests. I am assuming you already have your tests set up, most importantly getting an instance of your component under test.** We can now reassign our reloadPage function to an empty function**.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:embed {"url":"https://gist.github.com/thetombomb91/70ce0465b503fb2abffbc18f91156d65","type":"rich","providerNameSlug":"embed-handler","className":""} -->

Stubbing out our reloadPage call so location.reload() is not called

<!-- /wp:embed -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In the above code, we are stubbing out or overriding the function reloadPage from our component. In this test, reloadPage no longer calls **location.reload()**. It will call our empty function instead, thus doing nothing. We have essentially removed the **location.reload()** call from this test or more appropriately stubbed reloadPage out.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

_Again Note: In my situation, I did not want/need to test location.reload() with this test. I simply wanted to get past it, essentially ignore it._

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

After making these changes, the tests ran as expected. No more 1505 out of 490 tests. I hope this helped and if it did leave a comment!
