For the Fall 2017 Semester at California State University of San Marcos I have been hired on as an instructor for Intro to Mobile Programming course. I had been having an itch to get back into teaching, I felt like I had the time, and this opportunity came around, it was too good to pass up.The only issue, the course had previously been taught in entirely native Android (java) and iOS (Objective C) using their respective development environments as well. I have little experience in these native mobile environments but tons in Xamarin.Forms. I proposed teaching this mobile class using Xamarin.Forms, it was accepted and now I'm teaching!I know Xamarin.Forms, I develop in it every single day. But developing a curriculum and teaching it is a different beast.
